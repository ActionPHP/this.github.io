        <p>
          I gazed around with my blood-shot eyes like a starving beast and a mad man rolled into one.  I searched for a perfect way to understand <i class="red-text">`this`</i>. But, all I found was bits and pieces, scattered all over the place.
        </p>
      <p>
        It hurt but I had no choice. <b>To get better clients and better jobs, there was no way around it.</b>
        I had to learn how <i class="red-text">`this`</i> works. 
      </p>
      
        <p>

          Nothing seemed to explain <i class="red-text">`this`</i> really well. I'd think I got it. Then, 30 seconds later it was as if I hadn't even read anything.
         </p>
        <p>So... I dug in. Deeper.</p>
        
        <p>  I'd read. Then try it out. It would fail. Then, I'd make it work. Then it would fail again. I'd hate myself in secret, ashamed of the fact that I didn't really get <i class="red-text">`this`</i>. 
        </p>

        You know that feeling where the tutorial looks so boring that you just glaze over? Or, there is so much jargon that you say to yourself "If I knew what all these words meant, I'd probably not be here in the first place..."
      </p><p>

        Although, there comes a day when you have to take a stand. Plant your flag into the ground. Make up your mind that you won't move until you know what <i class="red-text">`this`</i> really means. As you may have guessed, that's exactly what I did.

        ...making myself some coffee...<br/>
        ...getting an energy drink to ensure the caffeine kicks in...
      </p>-->
      <p>It was all so confusing I almost gave up on myself.</p>

      <p>
          <b>And then I discovered something.</b>
      </p>
        <p>There is a method to <i class="red-text">`this`</i> madness.</p>
      <p>

        You may already know that JavaScript is weird. But, a thing ( or a person! ) is only weird when you don't understand them. (When you give them a chance though...)
      </p><p>

        What I discovered is simple. There is a predictable way to figure out what <i class="red-text">`this`</i> means. There are only a few possibilities when it comes to what <i class="red-text">`this`</i> could be in a specific script. Once you've grasp those bits, you'll never be scared of <i class="red-text">`this`</i> ever again.
      </p>
      <p>You'll be able to to use <i class="red-text">`this`</i>  in your own scripts. <b>In a job interview, you will explain how <i class="red-text">`this`</i> works - with ease and confidence.</b> Plus, you will know what it means when you're reading other people's code.</p>
        <p><b>Here is the best part.</b></p>
        <p>If you can follow simple steps, you can be a master of <!-- To be precise, there are 7 steps you can use to understand --><i class="red-text">`this`</i>. <!-- And, you can get these steps absolutely free when you join myDragon Master JavaScript Dojo.--></p>
